# Repository-wide agent guidelines

- Do **not** add or commit direct copies of the bitFlyer Lightning REST documentation (https://lightning.bitflyer.com/docs) or the realtime API documentation (https://bf-lightning-api.readme.io/docs/realtime-api) to the repository. Fetch these resources on demand during development and keep only summarized notes or references in project files.
- When referencing official documentation, capture only the necessary insights (e.g., endpoint lists, schema updates) and attribute the source with links and retrieval dates instead of duplicating the original text.
